### Word Jumble!

A word [jumble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumble) solver that also considers string subsets for the solutions.
Everything was done without using any helper modules or libraries.

#### Run test first

```
	python test.py



#### To run the program


```
	python jumble.py key path

Where key is the word you want jumbled and path is the path to the dictionary file, which will be used to compare all posibilities. In this case `db.txt`, however, if you wish to change the dictionary file, just replace the contents of `db.txt` with your own file.

**Remember** key and path values are **required** to run the program.

Feel free to make any pull requests to better any algorithms used.
